//// named.conf.key
////
//// key clause
////
//// Defines shared keys used to control and authenticate operations 
//// such as Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and the remote control channel (the 
//// controls clause). May be nested in a view clause.

//// Most common ones are given below as example:
////
//// DDNS_UPDATER key
//// used with isc-dhcpd or DHCP server for dynamic DNS updating
////
////     key DDNS_UPDATER {
////             algorithm hmac-md5;
////             secret "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv==";
////             };

//// NOTE: not recommended, used "rndc-confgen -a" and rndc.key file instead.
////
////     // counterpart key is frequently stored in rndc.conf (i.e., webmin)
////     key "rndc-key" {
////             algorithm hmac-md5;
////             secret "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv==";
////             };

//// rndc-remote key
//// used by remote rndc UNIX command
//// Note: do not forget to add additional remote access to controls clause
////       controls clause is in named.conf.controls
////
////         key "rndc-remote" {
////             algorithm hmac-md5;
////             secret "OmItW1lOyLVUEuvv+Fme+Q==";
////         };
////
//// Note: The keys clause above would normally be placed in a 
//// separate secure file and included into one of the named.conf file group.


//// for using "local-ddns" key (a default for session-based queries like
//// sftdyn), we declare:
////
////    session-keyname "local-ddns";
////    session-keyfile "/var/cache/bind/session.key";
////
//// in options group/clause within /etc/bind/options.named.conf instead

//// rndc-key key is defined in /etc/bind/rndc.key
//// rndc.key file is auto-generated by "rndc-confgen -a" command
//// rndc.key file gets included in both named's named.conf 
////     and rndc's rndc.conf files.

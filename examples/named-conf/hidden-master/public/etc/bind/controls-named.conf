//// Describes and controls access to the control channel used 
//// by the remote administrator when using the rndc utility.
////
//// The controls clause is used to define access information 
//// and controls when using remote administration services, for 
//// example, the rndc utility. The controls clause takes a 
//// single inet statement type, though more than one inet 
//// statement may be defined. Full list of statements.
////
//// controls clause syntax:
////
////    controls {
////       inet inet_spec [inet_spec]  ;
////    };
////
//// A controls clause is always defaulted and generates a TCP listen 
//// on port 953 (the default control port) of the loopback address 
//// for either or both of IPv4 and IPv6 (127.0.0.1 and/or ::1). If 
//// the remote administration will not be used, that is the rndc 
//// utility will not be used this control interface should be 
//// explicitly disabled by defining an empty controls clause as shown 
//// below:
////
////     controls {};
////
//// The primary access control method for remote administration, for 
//// example rndc in BIND 9, is via the use of keys defined within 
//// the inet statement (see below). To retain compatibility with 
//// previous versions of BIND or to run without a user generated key, 
//// a default key may be generated using the following command:
////
////     rndc-confgen -a
////
//// This command will create a file called rndc.key containing a 
//// default key clause with the name rndc-key in same directory as 
//// the named.conf file for the version of BIND being used and which 
//// is used for subsequent access to the control channel. If this 
//// command is not executed before BIND is loaded the following 
//// message will appear:
////
////     named [39248] none:0: open: /path/to/default/rndc.key: file not found
////
//// BIND will continue to run in this state but the control channel 
//// will not be operable. For full configuration of the inet statement 
//// and examples of its use in the controls clause see inet statements below.
////
////     inet
////
//// The inet statement defines a method to control access to the rndc 
//// (remote administration) utility. More than one inet statement may 
//// be included in a controls clause.
////
////     inet inet_spec [inet_spec] ..;
////
//// Each inet_spec parameter has the following format:
////
////    inet_spec = ( ip_addr | * ) [ port ip_port ] \
////                    allow {  address_match_list  } keys {  key_list  };
////
//// The ip_address parameter defines the IP address of the local 
//// server interface on which rndc connections will be accepted. 
//// The wildcard value ("*") will allow connection on any of the 
//// server's IP addresses including the loopback address. The 
//// optional ip_port parameter allows a specific port to be 
//// nominated for use by rndc connections. The address_match_list 
//// defines the permitted hosts that can connect to the rndc 
//// channel. The key_list parameter contains a reference to one or 
//// more key clauses containing the list of permitted users who are 
//// allowed access. While address_match_lists can include a key 
//// parameter if one is present in the referenced 
//// address_match_list it is ignored, only keys defined in the 
//// key_list of the inet statement are permitted access. The 
//// key_list can be omitted in which case the file rndc.key in 
//// the same directory as named.conf and which contains a default 
//// key clause with the name rndc-key will be used to provide 
//// default access. The rndc.key file is created by running 
//// the command:
////
////     rndc-confgen -a
////
//// The following example shows that a user on the loopback address 
//// can use the default key for access while all other users must 
//// use the rndc-remote key, in all cases localhost will use port 953 
//// (the default) and external connection port 7766. An acl clause 
//// is used as the source of the address_match_list:
////
////     // named.conf fragment
////     acl "rndc-users" {
////         10.0.15.0/24;
////         !10.0.16.1/24; // negated
////         2001:db8:0:27::/64; // any address in subnet
////         };
////         ....
////         key "rndc-remote" {
////             algorithm hmac-md5;
////             secret "OmItW1lOyLVUEuvv+Fme+Q==";
////         };
////     controls {
////         // local host - default key
////         inet 127.0.0.1 allow {localhost;};
////         inet * port 7766 allow {"rndc-users";} keys {"rndc-remote";};
////         };
////
//// Note: The keys clause above would normally be placed in a 
//// separate secure file and included into the named.conf file.


controls {

    inet 127.0.0.1 port 953 allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { rndc-key; };

    //// example below for remote rndc access via port 7766
    // inet * port 7766 allow {"rndc-user";} keys { "rndc-remote"; };
    //// need to add two ACLs: rndc-user and rndc-remote to named.conf.acl
};

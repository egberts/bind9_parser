//// File: named.conf

//// Title: primary configuration file for the BIND DNS server named.
////
//// egbert.net TLD: Authoritative Name Server (master)
////
//// Please read /usr/share/doc/bind9/README.Debian.gz for information on the 
//// structure of BIND configuration files in Debian, *BEFORE* you customize 
//// this configuration file.
////
//// If you are just adding zones, please do that in /etc/bind/named.conf.zones
////
////  Only include statement or clause keywords goes here.
////

////
//// key
//// key clause defines shared keys used to control and authenticate 
//// operations such as Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and the remote control 
//// channel (the controls clause). May be nested in a view clause.
////
//// key clause is defined forwardly ahead of acl, zone, and view.
include "/etc/bind/keys/named.conf.key";
// include "named.conf.managed-keys"
//// trusted-keys
//// Statically managed trusted-anchors for DNSSEC. 
//// trusted-keys may be nested in a view clause as well as in here.
//// include "/etc/bind/trusted-keys-named.conf"; // OBSOLETED


//// Access Control Lists. 
//// Defines one of more access control lists, groups of hosts or 
//// users identified by keys, that may be referenced in view and 
//// other clauses or statements.
include "/etc/bind/acl-named.conf";

//// Logging channels
//// Configures the location, level and type of logging that 
//// BIND performs. Unless you are using syslog you need a 
//// logging statement for BIND.
//// This logging section describes the logging clause which prior to 
//// BIND 9 needed to appear first in the named.conf file. This no 
//// longer the case and it may appear anywhere convenient. BIND 
//// uses syslogd before a valid logging clause is available so 
//// named.conf parse errors and other information will appear in 
//// /var/log/messages (depending on syslog.conf) prior to, or in 
//// the absence of, a valid logging clause. In the case of windows 
//// parse errors are written to the Event Log. Only one logging 
//// clause can be defined but multiple channels may be defined 
//// to stream logs.
include "/etc/bind/logging-named.conf";

//// Named daemon Options
//// Groups statements that control generic or global behavior and 
//// that have scope for all zones and views unless overridden 
//// within a zone, views or other clause
include "/etc/bind/options-named.conf";

//// Control channel
//// Describes and controls access to the control channel used by 
//// the remote administrator when using the rndc utility.
include "/etc/bind/controls-named.conf";

//// Masters
//// Defines a list of one or more masters that may be 
//// referenced from a masters statement in a zone clause of 
//// type slave or an also-notify statement in a zone clause 
//// of type master. Note: Somewhat confusing because the 
//// name, masters, is used for both the free-standing clause 
//// and a statement within a zone clause.
include "/etc/bind/masters-named.conf";

//// Servers
//// Only used if in a slave or cache mode (not master or hint)
// include "/etc/bind/servers-named.conf";


//// zone
//// Defines the specific zones that your name server will 
//// support. In addition there are a number of special zones 
//// that you may need to include. May be nested in a view clause.
////
//// zones are always inside view files, and not necessarily 
//// inside a view but usually so.
////
//// formerly known as include "/etc/bind/named.conf.local";
//// named.conf.local filename is too generalized for granular management
include "/etc/bind/zones-named.conf";

//// view
//// Controls BIND functionality and behaviour based on the host address(es).
//// 
//// Most commonly used to setup "split-horizon" serving of DNS records:
////     Serve up a set of records on one external interface while serving
////     up a different set of DNS record on an internal interface.
include "/etc/bind/views-named.conf";

//// statistics-channels
//// Defines access to XML (browser) statistics.
//// CIS recommends totally-disabling statistics-channels in production mode.
//include "/etc/bind/statistics-named.conf";

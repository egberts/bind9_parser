//// File: masters-named.conf
////
//// Defines a list of one or more masters that may be referenced 
//// from a masters statement in a zone clause of type slave or 
//// an also-notify statement in a zone clause of type master. 
//// Note: Somewhat confusing because the name, masters, is used 
//// for both the free-standing clause and a statement within a 
//// zone clause.
////
//// This file is used as top-level 'masters' clause
//// For view-specific masters, see 'view.<view-name>' or its include file.
////
//// This section describes the masters clause available in BIND 9.x 
//// which allows the user to define a list of zone masters from 
//// which notifies will be received and from which zone transfers 
//// may be requested. The masters clause may be referenced from a 
//// masters statement that may appear in a zone of type slave or 
//// an also-notify statement that may appear in a zone clause of 
//// type master.
////
////
//// Note: This can be a confusing clause. When used in a masters 
//// statement the list refers to IP addresses to which a transfer 
//// request may be made and from which a NOTIFY statement may be 
//// accepted. When used with an also-notify statement it refers to 
//// a list of IP addresses to which NOTIFY messages will be sent. 
//// There is a significant difference between these two uses.


//// masters clause syntax:
//// 
////     masters masters-name [port gp-num] [dscp gd-num] {
////                 ( masters-list | IP-Address /[port p-num] [key key] ) ; [...] }; 
////        };
//// 
//// 
//// masters-name is a unique name that references this masters list. 
//// It can optionally be enclosed in a quoted string, but if a 
//// space appears in the masters-name it must be enclosed in a 
//// quoted string, for example "my masters" (quoted string required) 
//// but my-masters (quoted string is optional). Multiple masters 
//// clauses may be defined, each having a unique masters-name. 
//// gp-num defines a port number that will be applied to all IP 
//// addresses in the defined list unless explicity overwritten by a 
//// port p-num element which applies only to a specific IP-Address 
//// (default in both cases is port 53). key-name refers to a key 
//// clause which may be use to authenticate the zone transfer or 
//// the NOTIFY message. From BIND9.10 the clause also allows the use 
//// of a DiffServ Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) number 
//// (range 0 - 95, where supported by the OS), defined by gd-num, to 
//// be used to identify the traffic classification for all IP address 
//// in the masters-list or the explictly defined IP-Address list.
//// 
//// <grovel> In previous versions of this page we indicated the 
//// masters-list structure was an address_match_list which allows, 
//// among many things, reference to an ACL clause. We were wrong 
//// (again). Our penance was to write a separate page defining 
//// the masters list format. </grovel>
//// 


////  NOTE: In other words, we cannot use ACL names here.
////      We can, however, created a form of ACL using 'masters' 
////      and have a masters option reference those masters-ACL(s)
////
////  NOTE2: key names defined in key option cannot be used
////         with 'any;' address, so blanket key match isn't possible
////         here.  This means that exposure of IP address of
////         any hidden master nameserver is still in the named.conf 
////         files. No way to avoid revealing hidden master's IP here.
////         In case you are wondering, dynamic hidden master nameserver
////         still remains a challenge, but not impossible.
